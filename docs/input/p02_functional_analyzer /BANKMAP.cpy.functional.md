## Functional Summary
The module defines a COBOL copybook structure for mapping bank-related data fields. It includes definitions for company, sort code, customer, account, process control, rejection, B2B transactions, clearing, SODD, NCOUNTER, and message fields. Each field is defined with a length and type, and some fields are redefined for different representations.

## API-Like Specification
